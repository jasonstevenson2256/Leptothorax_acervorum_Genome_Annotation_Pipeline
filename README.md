# Leptothorax_acervorum_Genome_Annotation_Pipeline
This is a repository and appendices for my MSc project report containing code, job scripts, and files used in and from my MSc project in which I annotated two genome assemblies; one of a functionally monogynous (FM) and the other a polygynous (P) L. acervorum individual.
